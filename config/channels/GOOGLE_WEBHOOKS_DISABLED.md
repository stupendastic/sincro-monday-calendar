# Google Webhooks Disabled for Unidirectional Sync

## System Conversion Notice

This system has been converted from **bidirectional** to **unidirectional** synchronization.

### Previous Configuration (DISABLED)

All Google Calendar webhooks have been **DISABLED** as part of the unidirectional conversion:

- ❌ Google Calendar → Monday.com webhooks REMOVED
- ❌ Push notifications from Google Calendar DISABLED  
- ❌ Incremental sync tokens REMOVED
- ❌ Google event change handlers REMOVED

### Current Configuration (ACTIVE)

Only Monday.com → Google Calendar synchronization is active:

- ✅ Monday.com webhooks → Google Calendar sync ACTIVE
- ✅ Monday.com is the single source of truth
- ✅ Google Calendar is read-only for synced events

### Files Affected

The following configuration files are now **OBSOLETE** and should not be used:

- `config/channels/google_channel_map.json` - **OBSOLETE**
- `config/channels/google_channel_info_*.json` - **OBSOLETE**  
- `config/webhooks/webhooks_personales_info.json` - **OBSOLETE**
- `config/sync_tokens.json` - **DELETED**

### Manual Changes Detection

Instead of webhooks, the system now provides passive monitoring:

- Use `google_change_monitor.py` to detect manual changes
- Manual changes are logged but NOT synced back
- Administrators are notified of conflicts

### Next Steps

1. **Stop all Google webhook channels** (see script below)
2. **Configure Google calendars as read-only** for synced events
3. **Train users** that Monday.com is the single source of truth
4. **Use monitoring system** to detect and resolve conflicts

## Disabling Google Webhook Channels

Use this script to properly stop all Google webhook channels:

```bash
# Run the webhook cleanup script
python scripts/testing/limpiar_webhooks_google.py

# Verify no active channels remain
python scripts/testing/verificar_webhooks_google.py
```

## Monitoring Manual Changes

```bash
# Check for manual changes in Google Calendar
python google_change_monitor.py

# Generate conflict report
python -c "from google_change_monitor import GoogleChangeMonitor; print(GoogleChangeMonitor().generate_conflict_report())"
```
